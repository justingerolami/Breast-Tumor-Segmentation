# Breast-Tumor-Segmentation
This is the residual U-Net code used for the paper "An End-to-End Solution for Automatic Contouring of Tumor Region in Intraoperative Images of Breast Lumpectomy". 

In this paper, we proposed an end-to-end solution for automatic contouring of breast tumor from intraoperative ultrasound images using two convolutional neural network architectures, the U-Net and residual U-Net. The networks are trained on annotated intraoperative breast ultrasound images and evaluated on the quality of predicted segmentations. Sample results are shown below.
